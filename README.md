# Refinery

This repo is ported from [Refinery](https://github.com/VorTECHsa/refinery) writen by Kotlin lang to C#(.Net Core)

Refinery is an open source tool to extract semi-structured data from Excel spreadsheets (both in `.xls` and `.xlsx` format) in a declarative way.

In the E-T-L process, refinery focuses on the E: Extract.

With declarative DRY schemas representing the expectations for a given data source, Refinery makes data pipelines more maintainable. 

All documentation is located under [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/VorTECHsa/refinery/wiki)
